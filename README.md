## Overview

![screenshot](btn-components.png)
<!--  -->

> 💻 In this project, I created a button styles library using **React**, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> 
> 📑The goal was to replicate the design of a provided webpage using **React components** for the buttons. 
> To achieve a responsive and adaptable design, I used display grid, a CSS technique that enables the creation of flexible layouts. 
> I also utilized props, a way of passing data between components, to customize the styles and content of the buttons. The result was a webpage displaying a variety of buttons with different sizes, colors, shapes, and effects
>  
> ⚠️ The webpage is purely visual and lacks any interaction with the user..
>  
> 💡This project allowed me to practice my React and CSS skills.
